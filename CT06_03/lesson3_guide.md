# Lesson 3 - Variables

## Recap 1: Pseudo Code Practice
Write a pseudocode that calculates the average score of the 4
students:

Adam: 60
Brandon: 58
Charlie: 98
Daniel: 79

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 1: Variables
**Task 1a**:
Create a variable named 'age' and assign your age to it.
Then print the value of 'age'.

**Task 1b**:
Assign the value 10 to a variable 'x'. 
Then reassign 20 to variable x. Print 'x'.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 2: Simple addition calculator
**Task 2a**:
Create 2 variables holding 2 different numbers:

## Example:
variable1 = 3
variable2 = 5

Print out the sum ("+") of the 2 numbers

## Example:
Output: 8

**Task 2b**:
Print out the product (‘×’), division (‘/’), and differences
(‘-’) of the 2 numbers.

## Example:
variable1 = 3
variable2 = 5

Output:
>>> 8 (addition)
>>> 15 (multiplication)
>>> 0.6 (division)
>>> -2 (difference)

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 3: Rounding practice

**Task 3a**:
Round 42.56789 to two decimal places.

**Task 3b**:
Round 1267.15 to the nearest integer.

**Task 3c**:
Round 1785.956 to the nearest hundreds.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 4: Mathematics with variables
For each of the following questions, create variables to hold
the values given before finally using print(ans) to print the
answer:

**Task 4a**:
Create 2 variables 'a' and 'b', assign any number to
them and print their sum.

**Task 4b**:
Subtract 10 from 50, then multiply the result by 3.

**Task 4c**:
Divide 100 by 4 and print the result.

**Task 4d**:
Calculate and print the result of (3 + 4) * 5 - (10 / 2).

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 5: Order of Operations practice
Code one Python expression to calculate and print the total cost for each task. Round the answer to 2 decimal places.

**Task 5a**:
- Two boxes of pineapple tarts - $15 each
- One packet of bak kwa for - $58

**Task 5b**:
A 10% service charge is applied, and a $25 off voucher is used, to the following order:
- One seafood platter - $96
- Three side dishes - $18 each
- Six bowls of rice - $2 each

**Task 5c**:
A 10% service charge is applied then, a 9% GST is applied, to the following order:
- Five seafood platters - $100 each
- Eight side dishes - $20 each
- Twenty bowls of rice - $2.50 each

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 6: Mathematical Function - abs 

**Task 6a**:
A warehouse robot's sensor records a movement of -55 meters due to an error causing it to move in the wrong direction.
Calculate the actual distance moved.

**Task 6b**:
A smart home sensor records a temperature change of -8 degrees in a room.
Calculate the total amount the temperature has changed.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 7: Mathematical Function – floor & ceil

**Task 7a**:
A bakery has 9.8kg of ingredients to use. Each batch of bread uses 1kg of ingredients to make.
Find the maximum number of batches that can be baked.


**Task 7b**:
A family buys 27 oranges. Each gift bag can hold 4 oranges.
Calculate the minimum number of bags needed to pack all the oranges.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 8: Mathematical Function – pi

**Task 8a**:
An athlete runs on a circular track with a diameter of 100 meters.
Calculate the distance of one full lap using the formula, circumference = π x diameter, and round the answer to 2 decimal places.

**Task 8b**:
You bought a pizza with a radius of 12cm.
Calculate the total area of the pizza to using the formula, area = π x radius², and round the answer to 2 decimal places.
