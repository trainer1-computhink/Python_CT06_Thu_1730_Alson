# Lesson 14 - Advanced Projects with Lists

## Recap 1: Die Rolling Simulator​
### 1a
Create a program that simulates the rolling of a die 5 times by storing each roll in a list.​

At the end of the 5 rolls, print the list.​

Example output:​ [4, 6, 5, 3, 4]​

Import the ‘random’ library​

Create an empty list called ‘rolls’​

Using a ‘for’ loop, and the ‘random.randint()’ function, append a​
random number generated into the list. Repeat 5 times.​

Print the ‘rolls’ list.

### 1b
Using a ‘for’ loop, expand your answer in Recap 1a to add up all the numbers in the list generated.

Example Output:​
[4, 6, 5, 3, 4]​
Sum: 22​

Create a variable ‘sum’ with the value of 0.​

Using a ‘for’ loop, loop through the ‘rolls’ list:​ Add each item in the list into the variabl‘sum’​.

Print the sum of all values in the list using string concatenation.

## Task 1: Printing Parallel Lists​
Create 2 parallel lists with 4 values each.​

fruits: List of fruits​
prices: List of prices of the fruits​

Use a for loop to print each fruit with its price in this format:​
 costs $.

## Task 2: Inventory Stock Checker​
### 2a
Create a program that: ​
checks a supermarket’s inventory stock levels and ​allows the user to search for an item.​

Loop through the given lists to check the status of the stock, if the 	stock is:​

Equal to 0 → Status: Out of Stock​
Less than 10 → Status: Low Stock​
10 or more → Status: Well Stocked​

Print the result in this format:​
Item:  | Stock:  | Status: ​

items = ["Apple", "Milk", "Bread", "Egg", "Chocolate"]​
stock = [15, 0, 8, 25, 3]

### 2b
Ask the user to input an item to
check.​
Check if the item is in the list.​
1. If the item is in the list:​
- Find its index​
- Print the result in this format:​
- Result: We have  (s) remaining.​
2. If the item is not in the list:​
- Print an error message​
- Error: Item not found in database.

## Task 3: Bookshop Shopping List​
### 3a​
Create a program that:​
- add items to a shopping list​
- calculate their costs​
- print a receipt​

1. Print the current shopping list.​
shopping_list = ["Pens", "Pencils", "Erasers", "Notebooks"]​

2. Ask the user how many more items they
want to buy.​

3. Use a for loop to ask what the items are and append it to the shopping list.​

4. Print the updated shopping list.​

### 3b
1. Create an empty list to store the
prices: price_list​

2. For each item in the shopping
list:​
- Ask for price​
- Ask for quantity​
- Multiply the price and quantity and append it to the price list​

3. Print the price list

### 3c
Use a for loop to print the shopping list and price list following
the format.

Add up the total cost in the price list and print it.

## Task 4: Scissors Paper Stone​
Create a scissors paper stone game, the user plays against a computer that picks randomly.

### 4a
Create a list of possible moves:​
["scissors", "paper", "stone"]​

Initialize 2 variables:​
- player_score​
- computer_score​

Use a while loop to ask for the user’s move while player_score and computer_score is less than 3.​

### 4b
In the while loop:​

1. Import the random library, use random.choice() to let the computer pick from the move list and print it.​

2. Compare the user’s choice and computer’s choice to determine the result.​

3. Increment player_score or computer_score depending on the result.​

4. Print the result and scores.

### 4c
1. Print the final result after the while loop has ended.​

2. Modify the loop to check for invalid choices.​
